# Laboratory Report for DAT250 Assignment 1

## Introduction

This laboratory report documents the development process and experiences encountered while completing Assignment 1 for DAT250 - Advanced Software Technologies. The primary objectives of this assignment were to set up a software development environment, develop software, and validate the functionality. This report will cover the technical problems faced during the installation of the software development environment, how they were resolved, the validation process, and any pending issues that were not resolved.

## Technical Problems during Environment Setup

During the initial stages of the assignment, I encountered some technical challenges related to setting up the software development environment. As I had limited prior experience with the specific tools and technologies required for this assignment, it took some time to become familiar with them. Specifically, I faced the following issues:

1. **Docker Installation**: Installing Docker was a crucial step in the setup process. I initially encountered difficulties while installing Docker on my system. However, I resolved this issue by following the installation documentation provided by Docker and ensuring that my system met all the prerequisites.

2. **Python and Flask Configuration**: As I was using Python and Flask for developing the software, configuring the development environment for these technologies was essential. I encountered minor compatibility issues between different Python versions and Flask dependencies. I resolved this by creating a virtual environment for the project, ensuring isolated dependencies, and managing them efficiently.

## Validation of the Software Development Environment

To validate the software development environment, I took the following steps:

1. **Virtual Environment Testing**: I created a virtual environment for the project and installed all required dependencies. This helped ensure that the software could run independently of system-wide Python packages and dependencies.

2. **Testing on Different Systems**: To further validate the environment, I tested the software on a friend's computer. This cross-system testing allowed me to confirm that the software could be deployed and executed successfully on different machines with varying configurations.

## Pending Issues

While I successfully addressed the technical problems mentioned earlier, there were no unresolved issues or pending problems encountered during the completion of this assignment. The software development environment was set up, the software was developed, and all tests and validations were successful.

## DockerHub Repository

The Docker image for the software developed in this assignment has been published on DockerHub. You can access the container at the following URL: [DockerHub - x104n/ass1](https://hub.docker.com/r/x104n/ass1).

## Conclusion

In conclusion, this laboratory report has documented the experiences, technical challenges, and solutions encountered during Assignment 1 for DAT250 - Advanced Software Technologies. The assignment primarily involved setting up a software development environment, developing software using Python and Flask, and validating the environment's functionality. All tasks were completed successfully, and the Docker image was published as required.

The experiences gained during this assignment have provided valuable insights into working with different software technologies and tools, and the successful completion of this assignment has bolstered my confidence in setting up and working within software development environments.
