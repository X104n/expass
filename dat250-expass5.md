# Report assignment 5

## Technical problems
For every Task i needed to switch this in the pom.xml file to be able to create the jar files
```
<properties>
    <start-class>
        com.example.accessingdatajpa.AccessingDataJpaApplication
    </start-class>
</properties>
```

also when i ran `./mvnw spring-boot:run` in the powershell i got that the build was successfull but i couldn't find the jar file.
