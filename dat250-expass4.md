## Pending issues

I have full understand of how the REST API and CRUD operations work. However the assignment text was very unclear, and i tried following this doccumentation: https://spring.io/guides/tutorials/rest/ but i was not able to get the code to work. Some problems i had was making the todo class an entity such that i could create an uniqe id for each todo, which i belive where the core of the problem. And since i did not get to assign unique id's and find the right dependecies for the project i was not able to confidently implement the rest of the assignment.
